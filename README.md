# Changes
1. Defined a Marker class to manage multiple (2) ArUco markers, allowing each marker to store its own pose matrix.
2. Calculated the relative pose matrix between pose matrices managed per marker, and displayed roll, pitch, and yaw (in degrees).
3. Enabled the Marker class to handle the display of information for each marker.
4. Implemented CLAHE as a preprocessing step to improve marker detection accuracy and robustness.
5. Added a display mode toggle with the 's' key to show/hide marker-specific information.
6. Enabled switching between relative poses from Marker ID 1 and Marker ID 2 using the 'r' key.
7. maker.py generates ArUco marker IDs 0 and 1.
8. Updated aeroTAP_CAM.dll:
   Now supports saving and loading the FocalLength value directly within the camera.
   Previously, a default standard FocalLength value was used, but now it can be set and handled as a camera-specific value.
   As a result, more accurate 3D data (X, Y coordinate values) can be obtained

# Algorithm - detectMarker_aeroSVD.py
 From the 2D marker corner coordinates obtained using cv2.aruco.estimatePoseSingleMarkers(),
 compute the 3D camera world coordinates and derive the transformation matrix from the 3D corner coordinates using SVD.
 Set standard marker coordinates as a reference and compute the transformation matrix 
 that relates them to the measured marker coordinates.
 If 3D coordinates cannot be obtained (i.e., corner distance coordinates cannot be retrieved or distance = 0), ignore them.

 Important: Since the depth data obtained from the 3D camera has fluctuations,
 a moving average is applied to smooth the values.

 If 3D coordinates cannot be obtained (i.e., corner distance coordinates cannot be retrieved or distance = 0), ignore them.

 Determine the z-axis using the normal vector (cross product).
 Define the x-axis using the vector between the first and second points.
 Compute the y-axis using the cross product.

 a moving average is applied to smooth the values.
